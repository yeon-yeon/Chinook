# Chinook

The Chinook database includes information about a fictional digital music shop.
It contains information about the songs, albums, and artists from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.

To check the various queries I wrote from the Chinook database, please refer to the files above with the name "Answering Business Questions at the Chinook record store.ipynb" and "complex queries.ipynb".

You can also see the table schema for this database in "table schema.jpg" file.

Thank you!
